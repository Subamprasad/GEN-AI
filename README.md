## Features
- **Animated landing page** with 3D falling stars and a moving background image.
- **Get Started** button opens a chatbox that simulates running `node LLM.js`.
- **AI chatbox**: Ask anything and get live responses from Gemini (Google GenAI).

3. **Start Chatting**

Great news! You already have your project on GitHub at:  
[https://github.com/Subamprasad/GEN-AI](https://github.com/Subamprasad/GEN-AI)

To make your project accessible via HTTPS so anyone can use it from any device, you just need to enable **GitHub Pages** for your repository. Here‚Äôs how:

---

## How to Enable GitHub Pages for Your Project

1. **Go to your repository:**  
   [https://github.com/Subamprasad/GEN-AI](https://github.com/Subamprasad/GEN-AI)

2. **Click on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab** (top right of the repo page).

3. **Scroll down to the ‚ÄúPages‚Äù section** (in the left sidebar, or scroll down if using the new UI).

4. **Set the source:**
   - Under ‚ÄúBranch‚Äù, select `main`.
   - Under ‚Äú/ (root)‚Äù, select the root folder.
   - Click **Save**.

5. **Wait a minute.**  
   GitHub will build your site. After a short time, you‚Äôll see a green success message with your new HTTPS link.  
   It will look like:  
   ```
   https://subamprasad.github.io/GEN-AI/
   ```

6. **Share this link!**  
   Anyone can now open your project from any device using this HTTPS link.

---

### Example

If your username is `Subamprasad` and your repo is `GEN-AI`, your link will be:  
**https://subamprasad.github.io/GEN-AI/**

---

## Important Security Note

Your current setup exposes your Gemini API key in the frontend.  
- This is fine for demos and learning, but **do not use this in production** or share your API key publicly for real applications.
- For production, use a backend server to keep your API key secret.
